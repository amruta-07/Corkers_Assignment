# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

### `npm install -g json-server`

This will install `json-server` globally on your system.

## Running the Project

To run the project, you can use:

### `npm start`

This will start the development server for your React application.

### Setting Up json-server

1. Create a `data.json` file in your project directory with your JSON data.
2. Run `json-server --watch data.json --port 30001` in your project directory.
3. The `json-server` will start and serve your JSON data at [http://localhost:30001](http://localhost:30001).

Now you can use `json-server` to mock your API endpoints for the project.
